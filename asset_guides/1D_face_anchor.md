# FACE ANCHOR Layout

## Global Sheet

- Aspect ratio: 5:2 (preferred) or 2:1
- Background: uniform neutral

## Horizontal Layout Grid

We define everything in relative percentages of total width/height.

## Horizontal Structure (Width)

```
| 6% | PANEL | 5% | PANEL | 5% | PANEL | 6% |
```

- Outer margins: 6% each side
- Gutters: 5% between panels

## Panel Width

```
Panel width = (100% - 6% - 6% - 5% - 5%) / 3 = 26%
```

So:

- Each panel ≈ 26% of total width

## Vertical Structure (Height)

```
| 5% top margin |
| 70% image area |
| 5% gap |
| 10% label band |
| 10% bottom margin |`
```

## Panel Internal Framing

Inside each panel:

- Top clearance: 6–8% of panel height
- Bottom clearance: 6–8%
- Head centered vertically within the image area

## Label Band

Each panel has its own label zone:

- Height: ~10% of total sheet height
- Text centered horizontally in panel
- Vertically centered within label band

## Alignment Rules

- All panels:
  - same height
  - same vertical position
  - same head scale
- All labels:
  - same baseline
  - perfectly aligned horizontally
